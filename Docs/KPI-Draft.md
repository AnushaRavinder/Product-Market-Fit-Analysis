#AQI Analytics - KPI Plan 

🧭 Dashboard Questions → KPI Strategy
1️⃣ What pollutants or particles should their air purifier target?
🧪 Metric:

Average levels of PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3 by region

📊 Visual:

Bar chart comparing pollutants per city

Highlight those exceeding WHO safe limits

✅ Outcome:

Identify top harmful pollutants per geography → product focus

2️⃣ What are the most essential features that should be incorporated into the air purifier?
📊 Strategy:

Rank pollutants by severity and frequency

Link to air purifier features (e.g., HEPA for PM2.5, carbon filter for gases)

🧠 Visual Tip:

Matrix or priority scorecard (Pollutant → Suggested Filter → Frequency)

✅ Outcome:

Feature design linked to real-world AQI data

3️⃣ Which cities have the highest demand, and what is the market size in these regions?
🧪 Metric:

Cities with highest average AQI

Overlay with population or sales potential (if data available)

📊 Visual:

Geo heatmap of cities by AQI

Table: City | Avg AQI | Estimated Households | Potential Market

✅ Outcome:

Target launch regions, prioritize cities

4️⃣ How can R&D be aligned with localized pollution patterns?
🧪 Metric:

Seasonal trends in pollutant levels (e.g., PM2.5 high in winter)

📊 Visual:

Line charts: Monthly PM2.5/PM10 by city

Layer with weather data if available (optional)

✅ Outcome:

Help R&D tune filter performance by location + season
